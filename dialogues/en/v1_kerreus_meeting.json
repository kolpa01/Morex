    "text": "Hello Friend!\nMy name is Kerreus Gorua. I'm the adventurer. As the member of the Guild my task is to inform my younger colleagues how to start their journey. Since you are one of them I have three things to tell you. On the Training Arena you can take part in fighting training, so you know how to fight. This is really important, because there are many dangers that lie ahead on your path. My sister conducts the training, so I can assure you that you will learn really quickly. There is also a mine in which you can get resources. Your first visit is free. Unfortunately you have to pay really much for the next visits. The last one is about the merchants. Here inside the forest are two merchants. One of them is called Kusel. He sells the items which is necessary to get into the Cave. He will probably want you to complete some kind of quest made by him, but the treasures from the Cave are worth it. The second merchants is... how do I say it... weird. Always under the hood... The best thing for you to do is to simply avoid him, but if you accidentaly enter his shop run from there as fast as possible.\nThat would be all. I won't hold you up any longer. See you soon! Maybe we'll meet again!"
